# About Dataset
The datasets provided include the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 23. The data allows multiple comparisons for the same players across the last 9 versions of the videogame.

Some ideas of possible analysis:

Historical comparison between Messi and Ronaldo (what skill attributes changed the most during time - compared to real-life stats);

Ideal budget to create a competitive team (at the level of top n teams in Europe) and at which point the budget does not allow to buy significantly better players for the 11-men lineup. An extra is the same comparison with the Potential attribute for the lineup instead of the Overall attribute;

Sample analysis of top n% players (e.g. top 5% of the player) to see if some important attributes as Agility or BallControl or Strength have been popular or not acroos the FIFA versions.
